# Mastermind
## Description
Our project is to create a multiplayer version of the game Mastermind. Mastermind is a game where one client must input a pattern of colors, while the second user must guess that pattern. The client who is guessing has a certain amount of tries to successfully guess the correct pattern. For each guess a hint is displayed that tells the user how many colors they guessed correctly in no particular order. 
## Features
1. Both clients can connect to the server
2. One user can send a pattern to the server, which will then send to the other client
3. One client can take a guess at the pattern and the server verifies whether it is correct.
4. Once the game is over the server can ask for another
5. Game has a p2p connection, so can not start unless there are both clients are connecting
